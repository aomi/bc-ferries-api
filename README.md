## ðŸ›³ BC Ferries API - [bcferriesapi.ca](https://bcferriesapi.ca)

The only public API for retrieving current data on BC Ferries sailings.

## How It's Made

BC Ferries API is a Go api connected to a web scraper. The scraper is made with Goquerey. It runs every minute and saves the relevant, formatted data to a json file. When the api recieves a request, it checks the validity of the request, then returns the specified data.

The frontend is made with HTML, Bootstrap, and Javascript. When the user hits the request button, it runs a small script that calls the api with the user's request, and displays the info on the page.

## API Reference

This API uses the route codes used by BC Ferries, they are:

```
"TSA" -> Tsawwassen
"SWB" -> Swartz Bay
"SGI" -> Southern Gulf Islands
"DUK" -> Duke Point (Nanaimo)
"FUL" -> Fulford Harbour (Salt Spring Island)
"HSB" -> Horseshoe Bay
"NAN" -> Departure Bay (Nanaimo)
"LNG" -> Langford
"BOW" -> Bowen Island
```

The api runs on the format:

`https://www.bcferriesapi.ca/api/<departure-terminal>/<destination-terminal>`

You can be as specific as needed, the fewer arguments there are, the more data you will recieve.

For example, `https://www.bcferriesapi.ca/api/tsawwassen` will return all data for all sailings leaving from Tsawwassen.

A request to `https://www.bcferriesapi.ca/api/` will return a full schedule for all terminals.

Options for each are as follows:

### departure-terminal

```
"TSA"
"SWB"
"HSB"
"DUK"
"LNG"
"NAN"
```

### destination-terminal

Note: destination terminal must correspond with departure terminal, for example you can't put tsawwassen to langdale, it will return an error.
